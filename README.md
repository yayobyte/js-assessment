# Project description

1. Create a React App with the following two inputs. Using a boilerplate like create-react-app is fine.
    1. A multiline text input that will accept a list of names, one per line.
    2. A dropdown that allows the user to select one of several languages.
2. Generate name tags for each name in the text input with a greeting in the language corresponding to the language chosen in the dropdown.
3. Make the source available as a cloneable repo, for example, on Github, and provide the link below. Be sure to include instructions on how to run the application in the README.
